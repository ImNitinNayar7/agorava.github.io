Version 0.5.2 just hit Maven Central, what's new in this release and what to expect in the coming months

h3. It's been a long time

We didn't have much time lately to work on Agorava Core but that's going to change in the coming month.
On the module side, some initiative were started (among them stackoverflow, github, instagram...). We'll post about them later.

h3. What's coming next in core ?

We're now actively working on API simplification and OpenWebBeans support in core. After that we'll be working by integrating our own OAuth engine and provide a JAX-RS implementation of it. You can follow the roadmap on our "Jira instance":http://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGOVA 

h3. What's coming next in modules ?

Our main modules (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) are still in snapshot. We expect to release them during Q3 2013. Stay tuned and thanks for your patience
